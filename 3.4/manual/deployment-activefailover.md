Active Failover Deployment
==========================

This _Section_ describes how to deploy an _Active Failover_ environment.

For a general introduction to _Active Failover_, please refer to the
[Active Failover](architecture-deploymentmodes-activefailover.html) chapter.

There are two main ways to start an _Active Failover_ setup:

1. using the [_ArangoDB Starter_](deployment-activefailover-usingthestarter.html) (possibly in conjunction with
docker), or
1. [manually](deployment-activefailover-manualstart.html).
