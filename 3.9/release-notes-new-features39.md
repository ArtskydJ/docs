### More powerful arangovpack

The _arangovpack_ utility supports more input and output formats (JSON and
VelocyPack, plain or hex-encoded). The former options `--json` and `--pretty`
have been removed and have been replaced with separate options for specifying
the input and output types:

- `--input-type` (`json`, `json-hex`, `vpack`, `vpack-hex`)
- `--output-type` (`json`, `json-pretty`, `vpack`, `vpack-hex`)

The former option `--print-non-json` has been replaced with the new option
`--fail-on-non-json` which makes arangovpack fail when trying to emit non-JSON
types to JSON output.
